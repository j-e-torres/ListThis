- cannot create more lists

# listAddUser not really working.

- added user shows up in viewusermodal, but does not show up in params

- keyboard viewing when in textinput
  - editing notes
    - √ (kinda) when edit is pressed, move cursor to notes
  - create list

# `Login/Home page`

- √ unless user deletes own token/logout
  - put logout button in nav

# `Nav`

- need an icon in top corner for a dropdown
- will show groups and animate like slack from left
- user skips Root screen if alrdy logged in with token
