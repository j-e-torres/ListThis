### Things to do

# listAddUser not really working.

- added user shows up in viewusermodal, but does not show up in params

# UX issues

- editing notes
  - √ (kinda) when edit is pressed, move cursor to notes
- create list
- see list as it is being created, make listitems the create list modal
- can use back button on android from home to go back to login screen
- after deleting tasks, tasks still show up in UserLists

# `Nav`

- user skips Root screen if alrdy logged in with token
- put logout button in nav

# `Functionality`

- show password functionality
- remove a user from list
- remove yourself from a list
- complete/delete a list
