### Things to do

# listAddUser not really working.

- added user shows up in viewusermodal, but does not show up in list params

- âˆš (kinda) when edit is pressed, move cursor to notes
- can use back button on android from home to go back to login screen
- after deleting tasks, tasks still show up in UserLists

# `Nav`

- user skips Root screen if alrdy logged in with token
- put logout button in nav

# `Functionality`

- show password functionality
- remove a user from list
- remove yourself from a list
