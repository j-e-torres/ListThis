### Things to do

# Issues

- when creating new group, viewUser modal shows no user instead of at least 1(group creator)

- can use back button on android from home to go back to login screen
- new tasks created are not sorted
- logged in user id does not match heroku sometimes?
- adding user to group must be lowercase

# `Login/Home page`

- √ Need a page for login or register options
- √ logged in user must persist
  - √ unless user deletes own token/logout

# `Nav`

- need an icon in top corner for a dropdown
- will show groups and animate like slack from left
- user skips Root screen if alrdy logged in with token

# `Functionality`

- √ Create a group with current user
- √ Create a list for group

- √ Create logout button
- √ add user to current group
- √ Create new task for list
- √ complete a task
- √ delete a task
